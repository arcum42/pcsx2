This is highly likely to get out of date quickly, and will be a rough guide to what's in files for purposes of refactoring, general knowledge of code, etc...

Also, the initial information is going to be pretty obvious, as it's off the top of my head.

--arcum42

First off, anything windows in here is broken and probably in need of mass reworking.

CMakeLists.txt -
Main make file.

buildshaders.bat - Windows, for building shaders.
shaders.sh  - Linux version of the same.
 
ZeroGSShaders/ :
CMakeLists.txt  copytozerogs.bat  ZeroGSShaders_2005.sln  zerogsshaders.cpp  zerogsshaders.h  zlib  zpipe.cpp  zpipe.h
Should probably move everything shader related here.
 
ps2hw_gl4.h 
ps2hw_gl4.glsl   
ps2hw.dat      
ps2hw.glsl      
ps2hw.fx      

Win32/ :
Out of date Windows files. Fix up later.

Linux/ :
Conf.cpp  Linux.cpp  Linux.h
Dialog stuff.

GLWin32.cpp -
Not in Win32 folder for some reason?

GLWinX11.cpp  - 
X11 Windowing stuff. Could combine with GSCreate?

GLWin.h  

ctx0/ & ctx1/ :        
Both contain ps2hw_ctx.fx for shaders. Needs looking at.

Memory/
HostMemory.cpp  HostMemory.h  Mem.cpp  Mem.h  Mem_Swizzle.cpp  Mem_Swizzle.h  Mem_Tables.cpp  Mem_Transmit.h

Memory files, subdivided in a million pieces. Mem_Tables.cpp has tables of how the blocks are arranged.
Has the actual memory storage, things for accessing it through pages and blocks and such.

Targets/
targets.cpp  & targets.h  \
ZZDepthTargets.cpp  & ZZDepthTargets.h   \
ZZMemoryTargets.cpp & ZZMemoryTargets.h   \
ZZRenderTargets.cpp  & ZZRenderTargets.h  \
ZZTargets.h :
Was once one file!
targets.h is rather overloaded. Some stuff can't be broken out of there that should, as it holds class defs for depth, memory, and render targets. Compilation totally dies if I try to split those out.
I might be able to split targets.h in half and put all of the classes in one file, though.

ZZogl  / (Dumping ground for various files)
Drawing.cpp  Drawing.h  -
Short. Prim and Kick functions

Flush.cpp  Flush.h  FlushHack.cpp  FlushHack.h  -
Flushing

GSCreate.cpp  GSCreate.h  - 
Main creation and destrution routines.

RenderCRTC.cpp  RenderCRTC.h  - 
Rendering stuff.

VB.cpp  VB.h  - 
Looks like stuff about frames?

ZZoglMath.h  - 
Vertex math. Not sure how much it's used.

ZZoglShadersGLSL4.cpp  ZZoglShaders.h  -
Shaders.

ZZSave.cpp - 
Save and load functions. Only used in GSmain, and is probably mergable.

glprocs.c  
glprocs.h -
OpenGLstuff.

GSDump.cpp & GSDump.h    -
Er, Open, close, transfer, ReadFifo, and VSync?
Used in GifTransfer and GSmain.

GSUniformBufferOGL.h & GSVertexArrayOGL.h  -
Code created for GSdx? 

Profile.cpp & Profile.h & Profile_gl3.cpp &Profile_gl3.h  - 
Profiling stuff?

README.txt  
Screenshots.cpp & Screenshots.h - 
Handles screenshots
      
Regs.cpp & Regs.h  
Main register handler. Header file is rather overloaded.

CRC.h        
ZZGl.h      
GS.h   
Util.h       


ZZLog.cpp & ZZLog.h - 
Main logging class

GifTransfer.cpp & GifTransfer.h - 
Gif Transferring code?

rasterfont.cpp & rasterfont.h  -
Font stuff for onscreen messages.

ZZClut.cpp  & ZZClut.h - 
Obviously clut (color) related stuff.

ZZHacks.cpp & ZZHacks.h - 
Structures for all the hacks.

GSmain.cpp - 
Main file

linux_replay.cpp  - 
?

ZZKeyboard.cpp -
Keyboard key handling
